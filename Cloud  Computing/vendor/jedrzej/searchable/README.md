# Searchable trait for Laravel's Eloquent models

This package adds search/filtering functionality to Eloquent models in Laravel 4/5/6.

You could also find those packages useful:

- [Withable](https://github.com/jedrzej/withable) - Allows eager loading of relations using request parameters
- [Sortable](https://github.com/jedrzej/sortable) - Allows sorting your models using request parameters
- [Pimpable](https://github.com/jedrzej/pimpable) - A meta package that combines Sortable, Searchable and Withable behaviours

## Composer install

Add the following line to `composer.json` file in your project:

    "jedrzej/searchable": "0.0.17"
	
or run the following in the commandline in your project's root folder:	

    composer require "jedrzej/searchable" "0.0.17"

## Setting up searchable models

In order to make an Eloquent model searchable, add the trait to the model and define a list of fields that the model can be filtered by.
You can either define a $searchable property or implement a getSearchableAttributes method if you want to execute some logic to define list of searchable fields.

```php
use Jedrzej\Searchable\SearchableTrait;

class Post extends Eloquent
{
	use SearchableTrait;
	
	// either a property holding a list of searchable fields...
	public $searchable = ['title', 'forum_id', 'user_id', 'created_at'];
	
	// ...or a method that returns a list of searchable fields
	public function getSearchableAttributes()
	{
	    return ['title', 'forum_id', 'user_id', 'created_at'];
	}
}
```

In order to make all fields searchable put an asterisk * in the list of searchable fields:

```php
public $searchable = ['*'];
```

It is also possible to blacklist model's attributes to prevent it from being filtered on.

You can either define a $notSearchable property or implement a getNotSearchableAttributes method if you want to execute some logic to define list of searchable fields.

```php
use Jedrzej\Searchable\SearchableTrait;

class Post extends Eloquent
{
	use SearchableTrait;
	
	// either a property holding a list of not searchable fields...
	public $notSearchable = ['created_at'];
	
	// ...or a method that returns a list of not searchable fields
	public function getNotSearchableAttributes()
	{
	    return ['created_at'];
	}
}
```

If you define both lists - searchable and not searchable columns - the resulting set of searchable fields will contain
all whitelisted attributes except all blacklisted attributes.

## Searching models

`SearchableTrait` adds a `filtered()` scope to the model - you can pass it a query being an array of filter conditions:

```php
// return all posts with forum_id equal to $forum_id
Post::filtered(['forum_id' => $forum_id])->get();

// return all posts with with <operator> applied to forum_id
Post::filtered(['forum_id' => <operator>])->get();
```

or it will use `Request::all()` as default:

```php  
// if you append ?forum_id=<operator> to the URL, you'll get all Posts with <operator> applied to forum_id
Post::filtered()->get();
````

## Choosing query mode
The default query mode is to apply conjunction (```AND```) of all queries to searchable model. It can be changed to disjunction (```OR```)
by setting value of `mode` query paramter to `or`. If the `mode` query parameter is already in use, name returned by `getQueryMode` method
will be used.
 
## Building a query

The `SearchableTrait` supports the following operators:
    
### Comparison operators
Comparison operators allow filtering based on result of comparison of model's attribute and query value. They work for strings, numbers and dates. They have the following format:
    
    (<operator>)<value>

The following comparison operators are available:

* `gt` for `greater than` comparison
* `ge` for `greater than or equal` comparison
* `lt` for `less than` comparison, e.g
* `le` for `les than or equal` comparison

In order to filter posts from 2015 and newer, the following query should be used:

    ?created_at=(ge)2015-01-01
    
### Equals/In operators
Searchable trait allows filtering by exact value of an attribute or by a set of values, depending on the type of value passed as query parameter. 
If the value contains commas, the parameter is split on commas and used as array input for `IN` filtering, otherwise exact match is applied.
    
In order to filter posts from user with id 42, the following query should be used:

    ?user_id=42
    
In order to filter posts from forums with id 7 or 8, the following query should be used:

    ?forum_id=7,8
    
### Like operators
Like operators allow filtering using `LIKE` query. This operator is triggered if exact match operator is used, but value contains `%` sign as first or last character.

In order to filter posts that start with `How`, the following query should be used:

    ?title=How%

```Notice:``` percentage character is used to encode special characters in URLs, so when sending the request make sure the tools
you use properly ```encode the % character as %25```
    
### Null operator
Null operator ```(null)``` allows filtering models whose attribute is null.

In order to filter posts that have no attachment, the following query should be used:

    ?attachment_id=(null)

### Negation operator
It is possible to get negated results of a query by prepending the operator with `!`.
    
Some examples:
    
    //filter posts from all forums except those with id 7 or 8
    ?forum_id=!7,8
    
    //filter posts older than 2015
    ?created_at=!(ge)2015
    
    //filter posts with attachment
    ?attachment_id=!(null)

### Multiple constraints for single attribute
It is possible to apply multiple constraints for a single model's attribute. 
In order to achieve that provide an array of query filters instead of a single filter:

    // filter all posts from year 20** except 2013
    ?created_at[]=20%&created_at[]=!2013%

## Filtering by relation attributes
It is possible to filter by attributes of model's relations - Eloquent's ```whereHas()``` will be applied. In order to filter
by relation, add the relation attribute to the list of ```searchable``` fields in the form ```relation:attribute```. The same string
should be used in the query to filter by that relation's attribute, e.g.:

     // allow filtering on user's active field
     protected $searchable = ['user:active'];
 
     // filter only posts of active users
     ?user:active=1
     
It's also possible to negate the search and filter objects that don't have a matching relation by applying Eloquent's ```whereDoesntHave()```. 
In order to do that, prefix relation name with ```!```:

     // allow filtering on comment's approved field
     protected $searchable = ['comments:approved'];
 
     // filter only posts that have approved comments
     ?comments:approved=1
          
     // filter only posts that have not-approved comments
     ?comments:approved=1
     
     // filter only posts that do not have approved comments
     ?!comments:approved=1

If you want to filter by a nested relation, just provide the nested relation's name with the dot replaced by colon. It's necessary as PHP
automatically replaces dots with underscores in the URL.

     // filter only posts that have comments from active authors
     ?comments:author:active=1

## Overriding default filter logic
It is possible to process selected filters with your own logic, e.g. when filter name doesn't match the name of attribute that is used for filtering
or some custom operations need to be executed. In order to override logic for filter `xyz`, you'll need to define a method in your model called `processXyzFilter`.
This method should return `true`, if filter has been processed and default logic should no longer happen.

```php
 // use one filter to search in multiple columns
 protected function processNameFilter(Builder $builder, Constraint $constraint)
 {
     // this logic should happen for LIKE/EQUAL operators only
     if ($constraint->getOperator() === Constraint::OPERATOR_LIKE || $constraint->getOperator() === Constraint::OPERATOR_EQUAL) {
         $builder->where(function ($query) use ($constraint) {
             $query->where('first_name', $constraint->getOperator(), $constraint->getValue())
                 ->orWhere('last_name', $constraint->getOperator(), $constraint->getValue());
         });

         return true;
     }

     // default logic should be executed otherwise
     return false;
 }
````

In order to override a filter for relation search, replace the colon in the filter name with underscore.
If you wanted to override logic for `user:active`, you'd need to define `processUser_ActiveFilter` method.
