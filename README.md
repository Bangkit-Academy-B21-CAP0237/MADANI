### Building Damage Classification

#### Dataset
We use xBD dataset, a dataset for assessing building damage from satellite imagery. xBD provides pre and post-event satellite imagery from a variety of disaster events with building polygons, classification labels for damage types, labels of damage level, and correspoinding satellite medatada. Detailed information can be found at [xView2](https://xview2.org/) site.

We use the Palu 2018 tsunami disaster satellite data provided by xBD which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/auliawicaksono/palu-disaster-satellite-images). This dataset contain 226 pre and post disaster satellite imagery, with 16,764 building polygons.
